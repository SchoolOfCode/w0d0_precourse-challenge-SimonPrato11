            Juan Manuel Fangio or El Maestro ("The Master" ), was an Argentine
            racing car driver. He dominated the first decade of Formula One
            racing, winning the World Drivers' Championship five times. He won
            the World Championship of Drivers five times—a record that stood for
            46 years until beaten by Michael Schumacher—with four different
            teams (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati), a feat that
            has not been repeated. He holds the highest winning percentage in
            Formula One – 46.15% – winning 24 of 52 Formula One races he
            entered. Fangio is the only Argentine driver to have won the
            Argentine Grand Prix, which he won four times in his career, more
            than any other driver.

          <h3>World championship successes</h3>
          <p>
            Fangio's first Grand Prix race was the 1948 French Grand Prix at
            Reims, where he started his Simca Gordini from 11th on the grid but
            retired. Back to South America, during a long-distance race, he went
            off the road in Peru and tumbled down a mountainside. His co-driver,
            Daniel Urrutia was thrown out of the car, and when Fangio found him,
            he was dying. Following Urrutia's death, he considered quitting the
            sport. But he resolved to carry on and returned to Europe the
            following year, and raced in Sanremo; having upgraded to a Maserati
            4CLT/48 sponsored by the Automobile Club of Argentina he dominated
            the event, winning both heats to take the aggregate win by almost a
            minute over Prince Bira. Fangio entered a further six Grand Prix
            races in 1949, winning four of them against top-level opposition.

          <h3>Legacy</h3>
          <p>
            The Formula1.com website states of Fangio: "Many consider him to be
            the greatest driver of all time." Several highly successful later
            drivers, such as Jim Clark, Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna, Michael
            Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton have been compared with
            Fangio,[citation needed] even as the qualities required for success,
            levels of competition, and racing rules have changed over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            His record of five World Championship titles stood for 45 years
            before German driver Michael Schumacher surpassed it in 2003.<strong>

              stands alone and what we have achieved is also unique. I have such
              respect for what he achieved. You can't take a personality like
              Fangio and compare him with what has happened today. There is not
              even the slightest comparison."</em
